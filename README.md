========

This repository holds python data analysis labs and class exercises for the General Assembly Data Science course. 

	The practice folder holds various code segments and short exercises I had written, to help complete lab and class exercises.
	
	Also note, in most cases corresponding data for the labs is not stored on GitHub (lab source code only).
	
 * **DS_HW03_EnronSubjLen** - using the provided sample Enron email database: Plot the median subject length over time (using the same weekly grouping object for previous exercise). This lab was completed using iPython notebook.
 
 * **DS_HW04_TwitterTrends** - this lab provides practice with pandas, mongodb, and the Twitter api. Some comparisons and counts were done on tweets and trends from the US and Canada.
